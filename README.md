## About

Omega-Themes `BETA` is the theme engine of [Omega](https://github.com/Omega-Numworks/Omega), an extension to Numworks' Epsilon. This engine allows you to change the theme of Omega easily before installing the OS.

## Installation

While compiling Omega, add the `OMEGA_THEME` flag :

```
make USERNAME="" OMEGA_THEME=the_name_of_the_theme -j4
```

There are 4 themes:
* Omega Light (`OMEGA_THEME=omega_light`)
* Omega Dark (`OMEGA_THEME=omega_dark`)
* Epsilon Light (`OMEGA_THEME=epsilon_light`)
* Epsilon Dark (`OMEGA_THEME=epsilon_dark`)

## An idea of theme?

- Don't hesitate to open an issue if you have any ideas.
- Soon, you'll be able to create your own themes repositories. We're working on this feature.
